Her versatile artistry, songwriting, and entrepreneurship have influenced the music industry, popular culture, and politics, and her life is a subject of widespread media coverage.\\nSwift began professional songwriting at 14 and signed with Big Machine Records in 2005 to become a country singer. She released six studio albums under the label, four of them to country radio, starting with Taylor Swift (2006). Her next, Fearless (2008), explored country pop, and its singles \"Love Story\" and \"You Belong with Me\" catapulted her to mainstream fame. Speak Now (2010) infused rock influences, while Red (2012) experimented with electronic elements and featured Swift\\'s first Billboard Hot 100 number-one song, \"We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together\". She departed from her country image with 1989 (2014), a synth-pop album supported by the chart-topping songs \"Shake It Off\", \"Blank Space\", and \"Bad Blood\". Media scrutiny inspired the hip-hop-influenced Reputation (2017) and its number-one single \"Look What You Made Me Do\".\\nAfter signing with Republic Records in 2018, Swift released the eclectic pop album Lover (2019) and the autobiographical documentary Miss Americana (2020). She explored indie folk styles on the 2020 albums Folklore and Evermore, subdued electropop on Midnights (2022), and re-recorded four albums subtitled Taylor\\'s Version after a dispute with Big Machine. These albums spawned the number-one songs \"Cruel Summer\", \"Cardigan\", \"Willow\", \"Anti-Hero\", \"All Too Well\", and \"Is It Over Now?\". Her Eras Tour (2023–2024) and its accompanying concert film became the highest-grossing tour and concert film of all time, respectively. Swift has directed several music videos and films such as Folklore: The Long Pond Studio Sessions (2020) and All Too Well: The Short Film (2021).\\nOne of the world\\'s best-selling musicians, with over 200 million records sold as of 2019, Swift has been named Global Recording Artist of the Year three times by the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry, whereas six of her albums have opened with over a million sales in a week. She is the highest-grossing female touring act, the most-streamed woman on Spotify and Apple Music, and the first billionaire with music as the main source of income. The 2023 Time Person of the Year, Swift has appeared on lists such as Rolling Stone\\'s 100 Greatest Songwriters of All Time, Billboard\\'s Greatest of All Time Artists, and Forbes\\' World\\'s 100 Most Powerful Women. Her accolades include 14 Grammy Awards (featuring a record four Album of the Year wins), a Primetime Emmy Award, 40 American Music Awards, 40 Billboard Music Awards, and 23 MTV Video Music Awards.\\nLife and career\\nEarly life\\n\\nSwift\\'s childhood home in Wyomissing, Pennsylvania\\nTaylor Alison Swift was born on December 13, 1989,[1] in West Reading, Pennsylvania.[2] She is named after singer-songwriter James Taylor.[3] Her father, Scott Kingsley Swift, is a former stockbroker for Merrill Lynch[4] and her mother, Andrea Gardner Swift (née Finlay), worked for a time as a mutual fund marketing executive.[5] Taylor has a younger brother, actor Austin Swift.[6]\\nSwift\\'s mother is of Scottish and German descent, and her father is of Scottish and English descent with distant Italian ancestry.[7][8] Swift\\'s paternal great-great-grandfather, Charles Carmine Antonio Baldi, was an Italian immigrant entrepreneur and community leader who opened several businesses in Philadelphia in the 1800s.[9][10][8] Her maternal grandmother, Marjorie (née Moehlenkamp) Finlay, was an opera singer.[11]\\nSwift spent her early years on a Christmas tree farm that her father had purchased from one of his clients.[12][13] She is a Christian.[14] She attended preschool and kindergarten at Alvernia Montessori School, run by Bernardine Franciscan sisters,[15] before transferring to the Wyndcroft School.[16] The family moved to a rented house in Wyomissing, Pennsylvania,[17] where Swift attended Wyomissing Area Junior/Senior High School.[18]\\nAt age nine, Swift became interested in musical theater and performed in four Berks Youth Theatre Academy productions.[19] She also traveled regularly to New York City for vocal and acting lessons.[20] Swift later shifted her focus toward country music, inspired by Shania Twain\\'s songs, which made her \"want to just run around the block four times and daydream about everything\".[21] She spent weekends performing at local festivals and events.[22][23] After watching a documentary about Faith Hill, Swift felt she needed to move to Nashville, Tennessee, to pursue a career in music.[24] She traveled there with her mother at age eleven to visit record labels and submitted demo tapes of Dolly Parton and Dixie Chicks karaoke covers.[25] She was rejected, however, because \"everyone in that town wanted to do what I wanted to do. So, I kept thinking to myself, I need to figure out a way to be different.\"[26] She spent summers in Stone Harbor, New Jersey until she was 14 years old, performing in a local coffee shop.[27][28]\\nWhen Swift was around 12 years old, musician Ronnie Cremer taught her to play guitar. Cremer helped with her first efforts as a songwriter, leading her to write \"Lucky You\".[29] In 2003, Swift and her parents started working with New York–based talent manager Dan Dymtrow. With his help, Swift modeled for Abercrombie & Fitch as part of their \"Rising Stars\" campaign, had an original song included on a Maybelline compilation CD, and met with major record labels.[30] After performing original songs at an RCA Records showcase, Swift, then 13 years old, was given an artist development deal and began making frequent trips to Nashville with her mother.[31][32][33] To help Swift break into the country music scene, her father transferred to Merrill Lynch\\'s Nashville office when she was 14 years old, and the family relocated to Hendersonville, Tennessee.[12][34] Swift attended Hendersonville High School[35] before transferring to Aaron Academy after two years, which better accommodated her touring schedule through homeschooling. She graduated one year early.[36][37]\\n2004–2008: Career beginnings and first album\\nIn Nashville, Swift worked with experienced Music Row songwriters such as Troy Verges, Brett Beavers, Brett James, Mac McAnally, and the Warren Brothers[38][39] and formed a lasting working relationship with Liz Rose.[40] They began meeting for two-hour writing sessions every Tuesday afternoon after school.[41] Rose called the sessions \"some of the easiest I\\'ve ever done. Basically, I was just her editor. She\\'d write about what happened in school that day. She had such a clear vision of what she was trying to say. And she\\'d come in with the most incredible hooks.\" Swift became the youngest artist signed by the Sony/ATV Tree publishing house,[42] but left then BMG-owned RCA Records (later bought by Sony Music) at the age of 14 due to the label\\'s lack of care and them \"cut[ting] other people\\'s stuff\". She was also concerned that development deals can shelve artists[33][23] and recalled: \"I genuinely felt that I was running out of time. I wanted to capture these years of my life on an album while they still represented what I was going through.\"[43]\\nTaylor Swift singing on a microphone and playing a guitar\\nSwift opening for Brad Paisley in 2007. To promote her first album, she opened tours for other country musicians in 2007 and 2008.[44]\\nAt an industry showcase at Nashville\\'s Bluebird Cafe in 2005, Swift caught the attention of Scott Borchetta, a DreamWorks Records executive who was preparing to form an independent record label, Big Machine Records. She had first met Borchetta in 2004.[45] She was one of Big Machine\\'s first signings,[33] and her father purchased a three-percent stake in the company for an estimated $120,000.[46][47] She began working on her eponymous debut album with Nathan Chapman.[23] Swift wrote or co-wrote all album tracks, and co-writers included Rose, Robert Ellis Orrall, Brian Maher, and Angelo Petraglia.[48] Taylor Swift was released on October 24, 2006.[49] Country Weekly critic Chris Neal deemed Swift better than previous aspiring teenage country singers because of her \"honesty, intelligence and idealism\".[50] The album peaked at number five on the US Billboard 200, on which it spent 157 weeks—the longest stay on the chart by any release in the US in the 2000s decade.[51] Swift became the first female country music artist to write or co-write every track on a US platinum-certified debut album.[52]\\nBig Machine Records was still in its infancy during the June 2006 release of the lead single, \"Tim McGraw\", which Swift and her mother helped promote by packaging and sending copies of the CD single to country radio stations. As there was not enough furniture at the label yet, they would sit on the floor to do so.[53] She spent much of 2006 promoting Taylor Swift with a radio tour and television appearances; she opened for Rascal Flatts on select dates during their 2006 tour,[54] as a replacement for Eric Church.[55] Borchetta said that although record industry peers initially disapproved of his signing a 15-year-old singer-songwriter, Swift tapped into a previously unknown market—teenage girls who listen to country music.[53][12]\\nFollowing \"Tim McGraw\", four more singles were released throughout 2007 and 2008: \"Teardrops on My Guitar\", \"Our Song\", \"Picture to Burn\" and \"Should\\'ve Said No\". All appeared on Billboard\\'s Hot Country Songs, with \"Our Song\" and \"Should\\'ve Said No\" reaching number one. With \"Our Song\", Swift became the youngest person to single-handedly write and sing a number-one song on the chart.[56] \"Teardrops on My Guitar\" reached number thirteen on the US Billboard Hot 100.[57] Swift also released two EPs, The Taylor Swift Holiday Collection in October 2007 and Beautiful Eyes in July 2008.[58][59] She promoted her debut album extensively as the opening act for other country musicians\\' tours in 2006 and 2007, including those by George Strait,[60] Brad Paisley,[61] and Tim McGraw and Faith Hill.[62]\\nSwift won multiple accolades for Taylor Swift. She was one of the recipients of the Nashville Songwriters Association\\'s Songwriter/Artist of the Year in 2007, becoming the youngest person given the title.[63] She also won the Country Music Association\\'s Horizon Award for Best New Artist,[64] the Academy of Country Music Awards\\' Top New Female Vocalist,[65] and the American Music Awards\\' Favorite Country Female Artist honor.[66] She was also nominated for Best New Artist at the 50th Annual Grammy Awards.[67] In 2008, she opened for Rascal Flatts again[68] and briefly dated the singer Joe Jonas.[69][70]\\n2008–2010: Fearless\\nTaylor Swift in 2009\\nSwift at the 2009 premiere of Hannah Montana: The Movie. She had a cameo appearance in the film and wrote two songs for its soundtrack.[71][72]\\nSwift\\'s second studio album, Fearless, was released on November 11, 2008, in North America,[73] and in March 2009 in other markets.[74] Critics lauded Swift\\'s honest and vulnerable songwriting in contrast to other teenage singers.[75] Five singles were released in 2008–2009: \"Love Story\", \"White Horse\", \"You Belong with Me\", \"Fifteen\", and \"Fearless\". The first single peaked at number four on the Billboard Hot 100 and number one in Australia.[57][76] It was the first country song to top Billboard\\'s Pop Songs chart.[77] \"You Belong with Me\" was the album\\'s highest-charting single on the Billboard Hot 100, peaking at number two,[78] and was the first country song to top Billboard\\'s all-genre Radio Songs chart.[79] All five singles were Hot Country Songs top-10 entries, with \"Love Story\" and \"You Belong with Me\" topping the chart.[80] Fearless became her first number-one album on the Billboard 200 and 2009\\'s top-selling album in the US.[81] The Fearless Tour, Swift\\'s first headlining concert tour, grossed over $63 million.[82] Journey to Fearless, a documentary miniseries, aired on television and was later released on DVD and Blu-ray.[83] Swift performed as a supporting act for Keith Urban\\'s Escape Together World Tour in 2009.[84]\\nIn 2009, the music video for \"You Belong with Me\" was named Best Female Video at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards.[85] Her acceptance speech was interrupted by rapper Kanye West,[86] an incident that became the subject of controversy, widespread media attention and Internet memes.[87] That year she won five American Music Awards, including Artist of the Year and Favorite Country Album.[88] Billboard named her 2009\\'s Artist of the Year.[89] She won Video of the Year and Female Video of the Year for \"Love Story\" at the 2009 CMT Music Awards, where she made a parody video of the song with rapper T-Pain called \"Thug Story\".[90] At the 52nd Annual Grammy Awards, Fearless was named Album of the Year and Best Country Album, and \"White Horse\" won Best Country Song and Best Female Country Vocal Performance. Swift was the youngest artist to win Album of the Year.[note 1] At the 2009 Country Music Association Awards, Swift won Album of the Year for Fearless and was named Entertainer of the Year, the youngest person to win the honor.[93]\\nSwift featured on John Mayer\\'s single \"Half of My Heart\" and Boys Like Girls\\' single \"Two Is Better Than One\", the latter of which she co-wrote.[94][95] She co-wrote and recorded \"Best Days of Your Life\" with Kellie Pickler,[96] and wrote two songs for the Hannah Montana: The Movie soundtrack—\"You\\'ll Always Find Your Way Back Home\" and \"Crazier\".[72] She contributed two songs to the Valentine\\'s Day soundtrack, including the single \"Today Was a Fairytale\", which was her first number-one on the Canadian Hot 100 and peaked at number two on the US Hot 100.[97][98] While shooting her film debut Valentine\\'s Day in October 2009, Swift dated co-star Taylor Lautner.[99] In 2009, she made her television debut as a rebellious teenager in an CSI: Crime Scene Investigation episode,[100] and she hosted and performed as the musical guest on Saturday Night Live; she was the first host ever to write their own opening monologue.[101][102]\\n2010–2014: Speak Now and Red\\nSwift singing into a mic while playing a banjo\\nSwift performing at the Speak Now World Tour in 2012\\nIn August 2010, Swift released \"Mine\", the lead single from her third studio album, Speak Now. The single entered the Hot 100 at number three.[103] Swift wrote the album alone and co-produced every track.[104] The album was released on October 25, 2010,[105] opening atop the Billboard 200 with over one million copies sold.[106] It became the fastest-selling digital album by a female artist, with 278,000 downloads in a week.[107] Critics appreciated Swift\\'s grown-up perspectives:[108] Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone wrote, \"in a mere four years, the 20-year-old Nashville firecracker has put her name on three dozen or so of the smartest songs released by anyone in pop, rock or country.\"[109] \"Back to December\", \"Mean\", \"The Story of Us\", \"Sparks Fly\", and \"Ours\" became subsequent singles, with the latter two reaching number one on the Hot Country Songs[80] and the first two peaking in the top ten in Canada.[98] She dated actor Jake Gyllenhaal in 2010.[110]\\nAt the 54th Annual Grammy Awards in 2012, Swift won Best Country Song and Best Country Solo Performance for \"Mean\", which she performed during the ceremony.[111] Swift won other awards for Speak Now, including Songwriter/Artist of the Year by the Nashville Songwriters Association (2010 and 2011),[112][113] Woman of the Year by Billboard (2011),[114] and Entertainer of the Year by the Academy of Country Music (2011 and 2012)[115] and the Country Music Association in 2011.[116] At the American Music Awards of 2011, Swift won Artist of the Year and Favorite Country Album.[117] Rolling Stone named Speak Now amongst its \"50 Best Female Albums of All Time\" (2012), writing: \"She might get played on the country station, but she\\'s one of the few genuine rock stars we\\'ve got these days, with a flawless ear for what makes a song click.\"[118]\\nThe Speak Now World Tour ran from February 2011 to March 2012 and grossed over $123 million,[119] followed up by the live album, Speak Now World Tour: Live.[120] She contributed two original songs to The Hunger Games soundtrack album: \"Eyes Open\" and \"Safe & Sound\", co-written and recorded with the Civil Wars and T-Bone Burnett. \"Safe & Sound\" won the Grammy Award for Best Song Written for Visual Media and was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song.[121][122] Swift featured on B.o.B\\'s single \"Both of Us\", released in May 2012.[123] She dated Conor Kennedy that year.[124]\\nTaylor Swift on the Red Tour\\nSwift on the Red Tour (2013)\\nIn August 2012, Swift released \"We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together\", the lead single from her fourth studio album, Red.

The song received a Best Original Song nomination at the 71st Golden Globe Awards.[142] She provided guest vocals for Tim McGraw\\'s song \"Highway Don\\'t Care\", also featuring Keith Urban.[143] Swift performed \"As Tears Go By\" with the Rolling Stones in Chicago, Illinois, as part of the band\\'s 50 & Counting tour,[144] and joined Florida Georgia Line at their set at the 2013 Country Radio Seminar to sing \"Cruise\".[145] Swift voiced Audrey in the animated film The Lorax (2012),[146] made a cameo in the sitcom New Girl (2013),[147] and had a supporting role in the dystopian film The Giver (2014).[148]\\n2014–2018: 1989 and Reputation\\nSwift performing on a mic, dressed in a blue skirt\\nSwift at the 1989 World Tour, the highest-grossing tour of 2015\\nIn March 2014, Swift began living in New York City.[note 2] She hired Tree Paine as her publicist[151] and worked on her fifth studio album, 1989, with the producers Jack Antonoff, Max Martin, Shellback, Imogen Heap, Ryan Tedder, and Ali Payami.[152] She promoted the album extensively, including inviting fans to secret album-listening sessions.[153] 1989 was released on October 27, 2014, and opened atop the Billboard 200 with 1.28 million copies sold.[154] Its singles \"Shake It Off\", \"Blank Space\" and \"Bad Blood\" reached number one in Australia, Canada and the US, the first two making Swift the first woman to replace herself at the Hot 100 top spot;[155] other singles include \"Style\", \"Wildest Dreams\", \"Out of the Woods\" and \"New Romantics\".[156] The 1989 World Tour (2015) was the highest-grossing tour of the year with $250 million in total revenue.[157]\\nPrior to 1989\\'s release, Swift stressed the importance of albums to artists and fans.[158] In November 2014, she removed her entire catalog from Spotify, arguing that its ad-supported, free service undermined the premium service, which provides higher royalties for songwriters.[159] In a June 2015 open letter, Swift criticized Apple Music for not offering royalties to artists during the streaming service\\'s free three-month trial period and stated that she would pull 1989 from the catalog.[160] The following day, Apple Inc. announced that it would pay artists during the free trial period,[161] and Swift agreed to let 1989 on the streaming service.[162] She then returned her entire catalog plus 1989 to Spotify, Amazon Music and Google Play and other digital streaming platforms in June 2017.[163] Swift was named Billboard\\'s Woman of the Year in 2014, becoming the first artist to win the award twice.[164] At the 2014 American Music Awards, Swift received the inaugural Dick Clark Award for Excellence.[165] On her 25th birthday in 2014, the Grammy Museum at L.A.

West claimed he had received her approval for the line, and his then-wife Kim Kardashian released video clips of Swift and West discussing the single amicably over the phone; a full recording leaked in 2020 established that West did not disclose that he would call her a \"bitch\".[173][174]\\nAfter briefly dating the English actor Tom Hiddleston,[175] Swift entered a six-year relationship with the English actor Joe Alwyn in September 2016.[176][177][178] She wrote the song \"Better Man\" for the band Little Big Town, which earned her the Song of the Year award at the 51st CMA Awards.[179] Swift and English singer Zayn Malik released the joint single \"I Don\\'t Wanna Live Forever\" for Fifty Shades Darker: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack (2017). The song reached number two in the US.[180]\\nIn August 2017, Swift successfully countersued David Mueller, a former radio jockey for KYGO-FM, who sued her for damages from loss of employment. Four years earlier, she informed Mueller\\'s bosses that he had sexually assaulted her by groping her at an event.[181] Also that month, after a one-year hiatus from the spotlight, Swift cleared her social media accounts and released \"Look What You Made Me Do\" as the lead single from her sixth album, Reputation.[182][183] The single was Swift\\'s first UK number-one single.[184] It topped charts in Australia, Ireland, New Zealand, and the US.[185] Reputation, released on November 10, 2017,[186] incorporated electropop, hip hop, R&B, and EDM.[187] Reviews praised Swift\\'s mature artistry, but some denounced the themes of fame and gossip.[188] The album opened atop the Billboard 200 with 1.21 million US sales[189] and topped the charts in the UK, Australia, and Canada.[190] Its singles \"...Ready for It?\", \"End Game\" (featuring Ed Sheeran and Future), and \"Delicate\" were released to pop radio.[191] Reputation was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Pop Vocal Album.[192] Swift featured on the country duo Sugarland\\'s \"Babe\" (2018).[193]\\nAt the 2018 American Music Awards, Swift won four awards, which made her accumulate 23 trophies in total and become the AMAs\\' most awarded female musician, surpassing Whitney Houston.[194] The same year, she embarked on her Reputation Stadium Tour,[195] which became the highest-grossing North American concert tour in history and grossed $345.7 million worldwide.[196]\\n2018–2020: Lover, Folklore, and Evermore\\nIn November 2018, she signed a new deal with the Universal Music Group; her subsequent releases were promoted by Republic Records. Swift said the contract included a provision for her to maintain ownership of her masters. In addition, in the event that Universal sold any part of its stake in Spotify, it agreed to distribute a non-recoupable portion of the proceeds among its artists.[197] Vox called it a huge commitment from Universal, which was \"far from assured\" until Swift intervened.[198]\\nA portrait of Swift\\nSwift at the American Music Awards of 2019, where she was named Artist of the Decade\\nSwift\\'s first album with Republic Records, Lover, was released on August 23, 2019.[199] Besides Antonoff, she worked with Louis Bell, Frank Dukes, and Joel Little.[200] Lover was her sixth consecutive album to sell more than 500,000 US copies in one week.[201] Critics commended the album\\'s free-spirited mood and emotional intimacy.[202][203] The singles \"Me!\" and \"You Need to Calm Down\" both peaked at number two on the Hot 100,[204] and other singles were the top-10 single \"Lover\", the top-40 single \"The Man\",[57] and the 2023 resurgent success, chart topper \"Cruel Summer\".[205] Lover was the world\\'s best-selling album by a solo artist of 2019,[206] and along with its singles earned nominations at the 62nd Annual Grammy Awards in 2020.[207] At the 2019 MTV Video Music Awards, \"Me!\" won Best Visual Effects, and \"You Need to Calm Down\" won Video of the Year and Video for Good. Swift was the first female and second artist overall to win Video of the Year for a video that they directed.[208]\\nWhile promoting Lover, Swift became embroiled in a public dispute with the talent manager Scooter Braun and Big Machine over the purchase of the masters of her back catalog.[209][210] Swift said she had been trying to buy the masters, but Big Machine would only allow her to do so if she exchanged one new album for each older one under a new contract, which she refused to sign.[209][211] Swift began re-recording her back catalog in November 2020.[212] Besides music, she played Bombalurina in the film adaptation of Andrew Lloyd Webber\\'s musical Cats (2019), for which she co-wrote and recorded the Golden Globe-nominated original song \"Beautiful Ghosts\".[213][214] Critics panned the film but praised Swift\\'s performance.[215] The documentary Miss Americana, which chronicled parts of Swift\\'s life and career, premiered at the 2020 Sundance Film Festival.[216] Swift signed a global publishing deal with Universal Music Publishing Group in February 2020 after her 16-year contract with Sony/ATV expired.[217]\\nAmidst the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, Swift surprise-released two \"sister albums\" that she recorded with Antonoff and Aaron Dessner: Folklore on July 24, and Evermore on December 11.[218][219] Alwyn co-wrote and co-produced a few songs under the pseudonym William Bowery.[220] Both explore indie folk with a more muted production compared to her previous upbeat pop songs[221][222] and earned Swift widespread critical acclaim and artistic recognition.[223][224] Each album was supported by three singles catering to US pop, country, and triple A radio formats. The singles were \"Cardigan\", \"Betty\", and \"Exile\" from Folklore, and \"Willow\", \"No Body, No Crime\", and \"Coney Island\" from Evermore.[225] Folklore made Swift the first woman to win the Grammy Award for Album of the Year three times at the 63rd Annual Grammy Awards[226] and was the best-selling album of 2020 in the US.[227] Swift became the first artist to debut a US number-one album and a number-one song at the same time with Folklore\\'s \"Cardigan\".[228] At the 2020 American Music Awards, she won three awards, including Artist of the Year for a record third consecutive time.[229] According to Billboard, she was 2020\\'s highest-paid musician in the US and highest-paid solo musician worldwide.[230]\\n2020–2023: Re-recordings and Midnights\\n\\nSwift performing in 2022\\nFollowing the masters dispute, Swift released re-recordings of her first six studio albums, beginning with Fearless (Taylor\\'s Version) and Red (Taylor\\'s Version) in April and November 2021, respectively. Both peaked atop the Billboard 200,[231] and the former was the first re-recorded album to do so.[232] Fearless (Taylor\\'s Version) was preceded by \"Love Story (Taylor\\'s Version)\", which made her the second artist after Dolly Parton to have both the original and re-recorded versions of a song reach number one on the Hot Country Songs chart.[233] Red (Taylor\\'s Version) was supported by \"All Too Well (10 Minute Version)\", which became the longest song in history to top the Hot 100.[234] The song was accompanied by a short film, which won a Grammy Award for Best Music Video[235] and Swift\\'s record third MTV Video Music Award for Video of the Year.[236]\\nSwift\\'s tenth studio album, Midnights, was released on October 21, 2022.[237] Characterized by a restrained electropop[238][239] and synth-pop[240] sound, the album was dubbed by Rolling Stone critics as an instant classic.[241][242] The album was her fifth to open atop the Billboard 200 with first-week sales of over one million copies and broke various sales and streaming records,[243] including the most single-day streams and most single-week streams on Spotify.[244] Its tracks, led by single \"Anti-Hero\", monopolized the top 10 of the Hot 100, making Swift the first artist to do so.[245] Two other singles, \"Lavender Haze\" and \"Karma\", peaked at number two on the Hot 100.[246] Swift won nine awards at the 2023 MTV Video Music Awards, including Video of the Year (\"Anti-Hero\") for a record fourth time.[247] At the 66th Annual Grammy Awards, she received Best Pop Vocal Album, and her fourth Album of the Year—the most for any artist.[248]\\nSwift released the third re-recorded album, Speak Now (Taylor\\'s Version), on July 7, 2023, becoming the woman with the most number-one albums (12) in Billboard 200 history, surpassing Barbra Streisand.[249] 1989 (Taylor\\'s Version), released on October 27, 2023, became Swift\\'s record-extending sixth album to sell one million copies in a single week in the US and surpassed Midnights for her career\\'s largest album sales week.[250] Its single \"Is It Over Now?\" debuted atop the Billboard Hot 100. Swift was 2023\\'s most streamed artist on Spotify,[251] Apple Music,[252] and Amazon Music;[253] the first act to place number one on the year-end Billboard top artists list in three different decades (2009, 2015 and 2023);[254] and the first living artist to simultaneously chart five albums in the top 10 of the Billboard 200.[255] She had five out of the 10 best-selling albums of 2023 in the United States, a record since Luminate began tracking US music sales in 1991.[256][257]\\nBeyond her albums, Swift featured on five songs from 2021 to 2023: \"Renegade\" and \"Birch\" by Big Red Machine,[258] a remix of \"Gasoline\" by Haim,[259] \"The Joker and the Queen\" by Ed Sheeran,[260] and \"The Alcott\" by the National.[261] For the soundtrack of the 2022 film Where the Crawdads Sing, she recorded \"Carolina\", which received nominations for Best Original Song at the Golden Globes and Best Song Written for Visual Media at the Grammy Awards.[262] Outside of music, Swift had a supporting role in the 2022 period comedy film Amsterdam and has signed to direct an upcoming feature film for Searchlight Pictures.[263][264]\\n2023–present: The Eras Tour and The Tortured Poets Department\\nSwift singing into a mic\\nSwift on the Eras Tour in 2023\\nIn March 2023, Swift embarked on the Eras Tour, a retrospective tour covering all her studio albums. Media outlets extensively covered the tour\\'s cultural and economic impact,[265] and its US leg broke the record for the most tickets sold in a day.[245] Ticketmaster received public and political criticisms for mishandling the tour\\'s ticket sales.[266] The Eras Tour became the highest-grossing tour in history, collecting over $1 billion.[267][268] Its concert film, released to theaters worldwide on October 13, 2023, grossed over $250 million to become the highest-grossing concert film, and was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Cinematic and Box Office Achievement.[269][270] Swift\\'s music releases, touring, and related activities culminated in an unprecedented height of popularity post-pandemic.[271] Music Business Worldwide remarked that she entered a \"new stratosphere of global career success\" in 2023.[272]\\nSwift began dating Kansas City Chiefs\\' tight end Travis Kelce in 2023.[273] In January 2024, AI-generated fake pornographic images portraying Swift were posted to X (formerly Twitter) and spread to other social media platforms, spurring criticism and demands for legal reform.[274][275] At the 66th Grammy Awards, Swift announced her eleventh studio album, The Tortured Poets Department, set for release on April 19, 2024.[248][276]\\nArtistry\\nInfluences\\nOne of Swift\\'s earliest memories of music is listening to her maternal grandmother, Marjorie Finlay, sing in church.[5] As a child, she enjoyed Disney film soundtracks: \"My parents noticed that, once I had run out of words, I would just make up my own.\"[277] Swift said she owes her confidence and \"fascination with writing and storytelling\" to her mother, who helped her prepare for class presentations as a child.[278][279]\\nSwift was drawn to the storytelling aspect of country music,[280] which was introduced to the genre by female country artists of the 1990s: Shania Twain, Faith Hill, and the Dixie Chicks.[281][282] Twain, both as a songwriter and performer, was her biggest musical influence.[283] Hill was Swift\\'s childhood role model, and she would often imitate her.[284] She admired the Chicks\\' defiant attitude and the way they played their instruments,[285] and was also influenced by older country stars like Patsy Cline, Loretta Lynn, Tammy Wynette, and Dolly Parton,[22] the last of whom she believes is exemplary to female songwriters.[114] As a songwriter, Swift was influenced by Joni Mitchell\\'s emotional and autobiographical lyrics, highlighting Mitchell\\'s 1971 album Blue as a favorite \"because it explores somebody\\'s soul so deeply\".[286] She also spoke of influence from 1990s songwriters such as Melissa Etheridge, Sarah McLachlan, and Alanis Morissette,[287][288] and alt-country artists like Patty Griffin[289] and Lori McKenna.[290]\\nVarious pop and rock artists have also influenced Swift. She lists Paul McCartney, Bruce Springsteen, Emmylou Harris, and Kris Kristofferson as her career role models.[12][291] 1989 was influenced by some of her favorite 1980s pop acts, including Peter Gabriel, Annie Lennox, Phil Collins, and Madonna.[292][293] She also cited Keith Urban\\'s musical style and Fall Out Boy\\'s lyrics as major influences.[294][295]\\nGenres\\n\"If there\\'s one thing that Swift has proven throughout her career, it\\'s that she refuses to be put in a box. Her ever-evolving sound took her from country darling to pop phenom to folk\\'s newest raconteur.\"\\n—The Recording Academy, 2021[296]\\nSwift is known for venturing into various music genres and undergoing artistic reinventions,[297][264] having been described as a \"music chameleon\".[298][299] She self-identified as a country musician until 2012, when she released her fourth studio album, Red.[300] Her albums were promoted to country radio, but music critics noted wide-ranging styles of pop and rock[301][302] and said that the melodies of her songs were rooted in pop, and the country music elements were limited to instruments such as banjo, mandolin, and fiddle, and her slight twang.[303][304] Some commented that her country music identity was an indicator of her narrative songwriting rather than musical style.[305][306] Although the Nashville music industry was receptive of Swift\\'s status as a country musician, critics accused her of abandoning her roots in favor of crossover success in mainstream pop.[307][308] Red\\'s eclectic pop, rock, and electronic styles intensified the critical debate, to which Swift responded, \"I leave the genre labeling to other people.\"[309]\\nMusic journalist Jody Rosen commented that by originating her musical career in Nashville, Swift made a \"bait-and-switch maneuver, planting roots in loamy country soil, then pivoting to pop\".[310] She abandoned her country music identity in 2014 with the release of her synth-pop fifth studio album, 1989. Swift described it as her first \"documented, official pop album\".[311] Her subsequent albums Reputation (2017) and Lover (2019) have an upbeat pop production; the former incorporates hip hop, trap, and EDM elements.[312][313][314] Midnights (2022), on the other hand, is distinguished by a more experimental, \"subdued and amorphous pop sound\".[315][316] Although reviews of Swift\\'s pop albums were generally positive, some critics lamented that the pop music production indicated Swift\\'s pursuit of mainstream success, eroding her authenticity as a songwriter nurtured by her country music background—a criticism that has been retrospectively described as rockist.[317][318] Musicologist Nate Sloan remarked that Swift\\'s pop music transition was rather motivated by her need to expand her artistry.[319] Swift eschewed mainstream pop in favor of alternative, folk and indie rock styles with her 2020 studio albums Folklore and Evermore.[320][321] Clash said her career \"has always been one of transcendence and covert boundary-pushing\", reaching a point at which \"Taylor Swift is just Taylor Swift\", not defined by any genre.[322]\\nVoice\\n\\n\"Cardigan\"\\nDuration: 22 seconds.0:22\\nSwift uses her lower register in \"Cardigan\" (2020).[323]\\n\"Lavender Haze\"\\nDuration: 18 seconds.0:18\\n\"Lavender Haze\" (2022) features Swift\\'s falsetto vocals in the refrain.[324]\\nProblems playing these files? See media help.\\nSwift possesses a mezzo-soprano vocal range,[325] and a generally soft but versatile timbre.[326][327] As a country singer, her vocals were criticized by some as weak and strained compared to those of her contemporaries.[328] Swift admitted her vocal ability often concerned her in her early career and has worked hard to improve.[329] Reviews of her vocals remained mixed after she transitioned to pop music with 1989; critics complained that she lacked proper technique but appreciated her usage of her voice to communicate her feelings to the audience, prioritizing \"intimacy over power and nuance\".[330] They also praised her for refraining from correcting her pitch with Auto-Tune.[331]\\nThe Los Angeles Times remarked that Swift\\'s defining vocal feature is her attention to detail to convey an exact feeling—\"the line that slides down like a contented sigh or up like a raised eyebrow\".[332] With Reputation, critics noted she was \"learning how to use her voice as a percussion instrument of its own\",[333] swapping her \"signature\" expressive vocals for \"cool, conversational, detached\" cadences and rhythms similar to hip hop and R&B styles.[334][335][336] Alternative Press stated that her \"evocative\" vocal stylings are more reminiscent of pop-punk and emo genres.[337]\\nReviews of Swift\\'s later albums and performances were more appreciative of her vocals, finding them less nasal, richer, more resonant, and more powerful.[304][338][339] With Folklore and Evermore, Swift received praise for her sharp and agile yet translucent and controlled voice.[340][341][342] Pitchfork described it as \"versatile and expressive\".[343] With her 2021 re-recorded albums, critics began to praise the mature, deeper and \"fuller\" tone of her voice.[344][345][346] An i review said Swift\\'s voice is \"leagues better now\".[347] The Guardian highlighted \"yo-yoing vocal yelps\" and passionate climaxes as the trademarks of Swift\\'s voice,[348] and that her country twang faded away.[349] Midnights received acclaim for Swift\\'s nuanced vocal delivery.[350] She ranked 102nd on the 2023 Rolling Stone list of the 200 Greatest Singers of All Time.[327] In a review of the Eras Tour, The New Yorker critic Amanda Petrusich praised the clarity and tone of Swift\\'s live vocals.[351] Musicologist Alyssa Barna said that Swift\\'s timbre is \"breathy and bright\" in her upper register and \"full and dark\" in the lower.[222]\\nSongwriting\\nFurther information: List of songs by Taylor Swift\\nSwift has been referred to as one of the greatest songwriters ever by several publications.[352][353][354] Literature scholars like Jonathan Bate and Stephanie Burt have noted that her literary and melodic sensibility and writing style are rare amongst her peers.[355][356] Swift\\'s bridges are often noted as one of the best aspects of her songs,[357][358] earning her the title \"Queen of Bridges\" from Time.[359] Mojo described her as \"a sharp narrator with a gift for the extended metaphor\".[360]\\nIn The New Yorker in 2011, Swift said she identifies as a songwriter first: \"I write songs, and my voice is just a way to get those lyrics across\".[12] Her personal experiences were a common inspiration for her early songs, which helped her navigate life.[361][362] Her \"diaristic\" technique began with identifying an emotion, followed by a corresponding melody.[363][364] On her first three studio albums, love, heartbreak, and insecurities, from an adolescent perspective, were dominant themes.[365][366] She delved into the tumult of toxic relationships on Red,[367] and embraced nostalgia and post-romance positivity on 1989.[292] Reputation was inspired by the downsides of Swift\\'s fame,[368] and Lover detailed her realization of the \"full spectrum of love\".[369] Other themes in Swift\\'s music include family dynamics, friendship,[370][371] alienation, self-awareness, and tackling vitriol, especially sexism.[279][372]\\nHer confessional lyrics received positive reviews from critics,[373][12][374] who highlighted their vivid details and emotional engagement, which they found uncommon in pop music.[375][376][377] Critics also praised her melodic compositions; Rolling Stone described Swift as \"a songwriting savant with an intuitive gift for verse-chorus-bridge architecture\".[378][379] NPR dubbed Swift \"a master of the vernacular in her lyrics\",[335] remarking that her songs offer emotional engagement because \"the wit and clarity of her arrangements turn them from standard fare to heartfelt disclosures\".[379] Despite the positive reception, The New Yorker stated she was generally portrayed \"more as a skilled technician than as a Dylanesque visionary\".[12] Tabloid media often speculated and linked the subjects of her songs with her ex-lovers, a practice reviewers and Swift herself criticized as sexist.[380][381][382] Aside from clues in album liner notes, Swift avoided talking about the subjects of her songs.[383]\\nOn her 2020 albums Folklore and Evermore, Swift was inspired by escapism and romanticism to explore fictional narratives.[384] She imposed emotions onto imagined characters and story arcs, which liberated her from tabloid attention and suggested new paths for her artistry.[363] Swift explained that she welcomed the new songwriting direction after she stopped worrying about commercial success.[384] According to Spin, she explored complex emotions with \"precision and devastation\" on Evermore.[385] Consequence stated her 2020 albums convinced skeptics of her songwriting prowess, noting her transformation from \"teenage wunderkind to a confident and careful adult\".[358]\\nSwift divides her writing into three types: \"quill lyrics\", songs rooted in antiquated poeticism; \"fountain pen lyrics\", based on modern and vivid storylines; and \"glitter gel pen lyrics\", which are lively and frivolous.[386] Critics note the fifth track of every Swift album as the most \"emotionally vulnerable\" of the album.[387] Awarding her with the Songwriter Icon Award in 2021, the National Music Publishers\\' Association remarked that \"no one is more influential when it comes to writing music today\".[388] The Week deemed her the foremost female songwriter of modern times,[389] and the Nashville Songwriters Association International named her Songwriter-Artist of the Decade in 2022.[245] Swift has also published two original poems: \"Why She Disappeared\" and \"If You\\'re Anything Like Me\".[390]\\nPerformances\\nFurther information: List of Taylor Swift live performances\\n\\nSwift performing on the Reputation Stadium Tour in Seattle in May 2018\\nJournalists have described Swift as one of the best live performers. Often praised for her showmanship and stage presence,[391][392][393][394][395] Swift commands large audiences,[396][397][398] without having to rely on dance like her contemporaries do.[399] According to V magazine\\'s Greg Krelenstein, she possesses \"a rare gift of turning a stadium spectacle into an intimate setting\", irrespective of whether she is \"plucking a guitar or leading an army of dancers\".[400] In a 2008 review of Swift\\'s early performances, Sasha Frere-Jones of The New Yorker called Swift a \"preternaturally skilled\" entertainer with a vibrant stage presence, adding \"she returned the crowd\\'s energy with the professionalism she has shown since the age of fourteen.\"[401] In 2023, Adrian Horton of The Guardian noted her \"seemingly endless stamina\" on the Eras Tour,[402] and i critic Ilana Kaplan called her showmanship \"unparalleled\".[403]\\nCritics have highlighted Swift\\'s versatility as an entertainer, praising her ability to switch onstage personas and performance styles depending on the varying themes and aesthetics of her albums.[404][405] Her concert productions have been characterized by elaborate Broadway theatricality and high technology,[406] and her performances frequently incorporate a live band, with whom she has played and toured since 2007.[407] Swift also often accompanies herself with musical instruments such as electric guitar;[408] acoustic guitar; piano;[409] and sometimes twelve-string guitar,[410][411] banjo,[412] or ukulele.[413] Interacting frequently with the audience, her solo acoustic performances are considered intimate and emotionally resonant, complementing her story-based lyrics and fan connection.[351][414] Lydia Burgham of The Spinoff opined that this intimacy remains \"integral to her singer-songwriter origins\".[415][409] Chris Willman of Variety called Swift \"pop\\'s most approachable superstar\",[416] and the 21st century\\'s most popular performer.[417]\\nVideo and film\\nFurther information: Taylor Swift videography\\nSwift emphasizes visuals as a key creative component of her music-making process.[418] She has collaborated with different directors to produce her music videos, and over time she has become more involved with writing and directing.

Rosen added that Swift \"falls between genres, eras, demographics, paradigms, trends\", leaving her contemporaries \"vying for second place\".[310] Critics regard Swift as a rare yet successful combination of the pop star and singer-songwriter archetypes.[497]\\nHer fans are known as Swifties.[266] Billboard noted only few artists have had her chart success, critical acclaim, and fan support.[498] Swift\\'s million-selling albums are considered an anomaly in the streaming-dominated industry following the end of the album era in the 2010s.[499][500] Economist Alan Krueger described Swift as an \"economic genius\".[501]\\nAlthough labeled by the media in her early career as \"America\\'s Sweetheart\" for her girl next door persona,[502][503] Swift has been accused by detractors of being \"calculated\" and manipulative of her image, a narrative bolstered by her 2016 dispute with West.[173][174] Critics have also noted that her personal life and career have been subject to intense misogyny and \"slut-shaming\",[504][505] as well as rampant media scrutiny and tabloid speculation.[506]\\nSwift\\'s private jet use has drawn scrutiny for its carbon emissions.[507][508] In 2023, a spokesperson for Swift stated that she had purchased more than double the required carbon credits to offset all tour travel and personal flights.[509][510] In December 2023, Swift\\'s lawyers sent a cease and desist letter to American programmer Jack Sweeney over tracking her private jet, citing safety concerns and stalking.[511][512] Swift has been a victim of numerous house break-ins and stalkers, some of whom were armed.[513][514]\\nLegacy\\n\"You have different artists dominating different sectors of the industry: Some are huge at streaming, some are big draws on the road. But we\\'re at this moment where there\\'s no one better than Taylor Swift, whether that\\'s on the radio, with streaming, ticket sales or just cultural impact.\"\\n– Jason Lipshutz, Billboard executive director, 2023[515]\\nSwift helped shape the modern country music scene,[516] having extended her success beyond the Anglosphere,[310][516] pioneered the use of internet (Myspace) as a marketing tool,[33][53] and introduced the genre to a younger generation.[517][310] Country labels have since become interested in signing young singers who write their own music;[518] her guitar performances contributed to the \"Taylor Swift factor\", a phenomenon to which an upsurge in guitar sales to women, a previously ignored demographic, is attributed.[519][520]\\nAccording to publications, Swift changed the music landscape with her genre transitions, a discography that accommodates cultural shifts,[521] and her ability to popularize any sound in mainstream music.[522] Lyrically, in being personal and vulnerable in her songs, music journalist Nick Catucci opined Swift helped make space for later singers like Billie Eilish, Ariana Grande, and Halsey to do the same.[523] Scholars have highlighted the literary sensibility and poptimist implications of Swift.[355][524] She has been credited with legitimizing and popularizing the concept of album \"eras\".[525][526] Swift is a subject of academic study and scholarly media research.[297] Various educational institutions offer courses on Swift in literary, cultural and sociopolitical contexts.[527][297]\\nSwift has influenced numerous music artists, and her albums have inspired a generation of singer-songwriters.[517][320][528] Journalists praise her ability to reform industry practices, noting how her actions changed streaming policies, prompted awareness of intellectual property in new musicians,[529][530] and reshaped ticketing models.[531] Various sources deem Swift\\'s music a paradigm representing the millennial generation;[532] Vox called her the \"millennial Bruce Springsteen\",[533] and The Times named her \"the Bob Dylan of our age\".[534] Swift earned the title Woman of the Decade (2010s) from Billboard,[535] Artist of the Decade (2010s) at the American Music Awards,[536] and Global Icon at the Brit Awards for her impact.[445] Senior artists such as Paul McCartney,[537] Mick Jagger,[538] Madonna,[539] and Dolly Parton have praised her musicianship.[540] Carole King regards Swift her \"professional grand daughter\" and thanked Swift for \"carrying the torch forward\".[541] Springsteen called her a \"tremendous\" writer,[542] while Ringo Starr and Billy Joel considered Swift the Beatles\\' successor.[543][544] Britney Spears labeled Swift \"the most iconic pop woman of our generation\".[545]\\nEntrepreneurship\\nMedia outlets describe Swift as a savvy businesswoman;[546][547] in 2024, she topped Billboard\\'s annual Power 100 ranking of the top music industry executives.[548] Swift is known for her traditional album rollouts, consisting of a variety of promotional activities that Rolling Stone termed as an inescapable \"multimedia bonanza\".[549][550] Easter eggs and cryptic teasers became a common practice in contemporary pop music because of Swift.[551] Publications describe her discography as a music \"universe\" subject to analyses by fans, critics and journalists.[552][553][554] Swift maintains an active presence on social media and a close relationship with fans, to which many journalists attribute her success.[555][487][556] Her in-house management team is called 13 Management.[557]\\nSwift has endorsed many brands and businesses, having launched clothing lines with L.E.I. and Stella McCartney,[558][559] designed American Greetings cards and Jakks Pacific dolls,[560][561] released a number of fragrances with Elizabeth Arden,[562] and signed multi-year deals with AT&T and Capital One.[563][564] She was a spokesperson for the National Hockey League\\'s Nashville Predators and Sony Cyber-shot digital cameras,[565][566] and became the global ambassador for New York City in 2014 and Record Store Day in 2022.[567][568]\\nSocial activism\\nFurther information: Political impact of Taylor Swift\\nSwift identifies as a pro-choice feminist,[569] and is a founding signatory of the Time\\'s Up movement against sexual harassment.[570] Specifically, she criticized the US Supreme Court\\'s decision to end federal abortion rights in 2022.[571] Swift also advocates for LGBT rights,[572] and has called for the passing of the Equality Act, which prohibits discrimination based on sex, sexual orientation, and gender identity.[573][574] She performed during WorldPride NYC 2019 at the Stonewall Inn, a gay rights monument, and has donated to the LGBT organizations Tennessee Equality Project and GLAAD.[575][576][577]\\nA supporter of the March for Our Lives movement and

Educational Fund and the Black Lives Matter movement,[580] called for the removal of Confederate monuments in Tennessee,[581] and advocated for Juneteenth to become a national holiday.[582] In 2020, Swift urged her fans to check their voter registration ahead of elections, which resulted in 65,000 people registering to vote within one day of her post,[583] and endorsed Joe Biden and Kamala Harris in the US presidential election.[584] She has openly criticized former president Donald Trump.[585]\\nWealth\\nSwift\\'s net worth is estimated by Forbes and Bloomberg News at $1.1 billion as of October 2023, making her the first musician to achieve billionaire status \"solely based on her songs and performances\".[586][587] Forbes named her the annual top-earning female musician in 2016, 2019, 2021, and 2022.[588] She was the highest-paid celebrity of 2016 with $170 million—a feat recognized by the Guinness World Records as the highest annual earnings ever for a female musician,[589] which she herself surpassed with $185 million in 2019.[590] Overall, Forbes listed Swift as the highest-paid female artist of the 2010s, earning $825 million.[591] She has also developed a real estate portfolio worth $150 million as of 2023, with properties in Nashville; Tribeca, Manhattan; Los Angeles (Samuel Goldwyn Estate); and Rhode Island (High Watch).[592]\\nPhilanthropy\\nSwift is known for

🅤🅝🅘🅒🅞🅓🅔‽ 🇺\\u200c🇳\\u200c🇮\\u200c🇨\\u200c🇴\\u200c🇩\\u200c🇪! 😄 The very name strikes fear and awe into the hearts of programmers worldwide. We all know we ought to “support Unicode” in our software (whatever that means—like using wchar_t for all the strings, right?). But Unicode can be abstruse, and diving into the thousand-page Unicode Standard plus its dozens of supplementary annexes, reports, and notes can be more than a little intimidating. I don’t blame programmers for still finding the whole thing mysterious, even 30 years after Unicode’s inception.  A few months ago, I got interested in Unicode and decided to spend some time learning more about it in detail. In this article, I’ll give an introduction to it from a programmer’s point of view.  I’m going to focus on the character set and what’s involved in working with strings and files of Unicode text. However, in this article I’m not going to talk about fonts, text layout/shaping/rendering, or localization in detail—those are separate issues, beyond my scope (and knowledge) here.  Diversity and Inherent Complexity The Unicode Codespace Codespace Allocation Scripts Usage Frequency Encodings UTF-8 UTF-16 Combining Marks Canonical Equivalence Normalization Forms Grapheme Clusters And More… Diversity and Inherent Complexity As soon as you start to study Unicode, it becomes clear that it represents a large jump in complexity over character sets like ASCII that you may be more familiar with. It’s not just that Unicode contains a much larger number of characters, although that’s part of it. Unicode also has a great deal of internal structure, features, and special cases, making it much more than what one might expect a mere “character set” to be. We’ll see some of that later in this article.  When confronting all this complexity, especially as an engineer, it’s hard not to find oneself asking, “Why do we need all this? Is this really necessary? Couldn’t it be simplified?”  However, Unicode aims to faithfully represent the entire world’s writing systems. The Unicode Consortium’s stated goal is “enabling people around the world to use computers in any language”. And as you might imagine, the diversity of written languages is immense! To date, Unicode supports 135 different scripts, covering some 1100 languages, and there’s still a long tail of over 100 unsupported scripts, both modern and historical, which people are still working to add.  Given this enormous diversity, it’s inevitable that representing it is a complicated project. Unicode embraces that diversity, and accepts the complexity inherent in its mission to include all human writing systems. It doesn’t make a lot of trade-offs in the name of simplification, and it makes exceptions to its own rules where necessary to further its mission.  Moreover, Unicode is committed not just to supporting texts in any single language, but also to letting multiple languages coexist within one text—which introduces even more complexity.  Most programming languages have libraries available to handle the gory low-level details of text manipulation, but as a programmer, you’ll still need to know about certain Unicode features in order to know when and how to apply them. It may take some time to wrap your head around it all, but don’t be discouraged—think about the billions of people for whom your software will be more accessible through supporting text in their language. Embrace the complexity!  The Unicode Codespace Let’s start with some general orientation. The basic elements of Unicode—its “characters”, although that term isn’t quite right—are called code points. Code points are identified by number, customarily written in hexadecimal with the prefix “U+”, such as U+0041 “A” latin capital letter a or U+03B8 “θ” greek small letter theta. Each code point also has a short name, and quite a few other properties, specified in the Unicode Character Database.  The set of all possible code points is called the codespace. The Unicode codespace consists of 1,114,112 code points. However, only 128,237 of them—about 12% of the codespace—are actually assigned, to date. There’s plenty of room for growth! Unicode also reserves an additional 137,468 code points as “private use” areas, which have no standardized meaning and are available for individual applications to define for their own purposes.  Codespace Allocation To get a feel for how the codespace is laid out, it’s helpful to visualize it. Below is a map of the entire codespace, with one pixel per code point. It’s arranged in tiles for visual coherence; each small square is 16×16 = 256 code points, and each large square is a “plane” of 65,536 code points. There are 17 planes altogether.  Map of the Unicode codespace (click to zoom)  White represents unassigned space. Blue is assigned code points, green is private-use areas, and the small red area is surrogates (more about those later). As you can see, the assigned code points are distributed somewhat sparsely, but concentrated in the first three planes.  Plane 0 is also known as the “Basic Multilingual Plane”, or BMP. The BMP contains essentially all the characters needed for modern text in any script, including Latin, Cyrillic, Greek, Han (Chinese), Japanese, Korean, Arabic, Hebrew, Devanagari (Indian), and many more.  (In the past, the codespace was just the BMP and no more—Unicode was originally conceived as a straightforward 16-bit encoding, with only 65,536 code points. It was expanded to its current size in 1996. However, the vast majority of code points in modern text belong to the BMP.)  Plane 1 contains historical scripts, such as Sumerian cuneiform and Egyptian hieroglyphs, as well as emoji and various other symbols. Plane 2 contains a large block of less-common and historical Han characters. The remaining planes are empty, except for a small number of rarely-used formatting characters in Plane 14; planes 15–16 are reserved entirely for private use.  Scripts Let’s zoom in on the first three planes, since that’s where the action is:  Map of scripts in Unicode planes 0–2 (click to zoom)  This map color-codes the 135 different scripts in Unicode. You can see how Han () and Korean () take up most of the range of the BMP (the left large square). By contrast, all of the European, Middle Eastern, and South Asian scripts fit into the first row of the BMP in this diagram.  Many areas of the codespace are adapted or copied from earlier encodings. For example, the first 128 code points of Unicode are just a copy of ASCII. This has clear benefits for compatibility—it’s easy to losslessly convert texts from smaller encodings into Unicode (and the other direction too, as long as no characters outside the smaller encoding are used).  Usage Frequency One more interesting way to visualize the codespace is to look at the distribution of usage—in other words, how often each code point is actually used in real-world texts. Below is a heat map of planes 0–2 based on a large sample of text from Wikipedia and Twitter (all languages). Frequency increases from black (never seen) through red and yellow to white.  Heat map of code point usage frequency in Unicode planes 0–2 (click to zoom)  You can see that the vast majority of this text sample lies in the BMP, with only scattered usage of code points from planes 1–2. The biggest exception is emoji, which show up here as the several bright squares in the bottom row of plane 1.  Encodings We’ve seen that Unicode code points are abstractly identified by their index in the codespace, ranging from U+0000 to U+10FFFF. But how do code points get represented as bytes, in memory or in a file?  The most convenient, computer-friendliest (and programmer-friendliest) thing to do would be to just store the code point index as a 32-bit integer. This works, but it consumes 4 bytes per code point, which is sort of a lot. Using 32-bit ints for Unicode will cost you a bunch of extra storage, memory, and performance in bandwidth-bound scenarios, if you work with a lot of text.  Consequently, there are several more-compact encodings for Unicode. The 32-bit integer encoding is officially called UTF-32 (UTF = “Unicode Transformation Format”), but it’s rarely used for storage. At most, it comes up sometimes as a temporary internal representation, for examining or operating on the code points in a string.  Much more commonly, you’ll see Unicode text encoded as either UTF-8 or UTF-16. These are both variable-length encodings, made up of 8-bit or 16-bit units, respectively. In these schemes, code points with smaller index values take up fewer bytes, which saves a lot of memory for typical texts. The trade-off is that processing UTF-8/16 texts is more programmatically involved, and likely slower.  UTF-8 In UTF-8, each code point is stored using 1 to 4 bytes, based on its index value.  UTF-8 uses a system of binary prefixes, in which the high bits of each byte mark whether it’s a single byte, the beginning of a multi-byte sequence, or a continuation byte; the remaining bits, concatenated, give the code point index. This table shows how it works:  UTF-8 (binary)\\tCode point (binary)\\tRange 0xxxxxxx\\txxxxxxx\\tU+0000–U+007F 110xxxxx 10yyyyyy\\txxxxxyyyyyy\\tU+0080–U+07FF 1110xxxx 10yyyyyy 10zzzzzz\\txxxxyyyyyyzzzzzz\\tU+0800–U+FFFF 11110xxx 10yyyyyy 10zzzzzz 10wwwwww\\txxxyyyyyyzzzzzzwwwwww\\tU+10000–U+10FFFF A handy property of UTF-8 is that code points below 128 (ASCII characters) are encoded as single bytes, and all non-ASCII code points are encoded using sequences of bytes 128–255. This has a couple of nice consequences. First, any strings or files out there that are already in ASCII can also be interpreted as UTF-8 without any conversion. Second, lots of widely-used string programming idioms—such as null termination, or delimiters (newlines, tabs, commas, slashes, etc.)—will just work on UTF-8 strings. ASCII bytes never occur inside the encoding of non-ASCII code points, so searching byte-wise for a null terminator or a delimiter will do the right thing.  Thanks to this convenience, it’s relatively simple to extend legacy ASCII programs and APIs to handle UTF-8 strings. UTF-8 is very widely used in the Unix/Linux and Web worlds, and many programmers argue UTF-8 should be the default encoding everywhere.  However, UTF-8 isn’t a drop-in replacement for ASCII strings in all respects. For instance, code that iterates over the “characters” in a string will need to decode UTF-8 and iterate over code points (or maybe grapheme clusters—more about those later), not bytes. When you measure the “length” of a string, you’ll need to think about whether you want the length in bytes, the length in code points, the width of the text when rendered, or something else.  UTF-16 The other encoding that you’re likely to encounter is UTF-16. It uses 16-bit words, with each code point stored as either 1 or 2 words.  Like UTF-8, we can express the UTF-16 encoding rules in the form of binary prefixes:  UTF-16 (binary)\\tCode point (binary)\\tRange xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\\txxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\\tU+0000–U+FFFF 110110xxxxxxxxxx 110111yyyyyyyyyy\\txxxxxxxxxxyyyyyyyyyy + 0x10000\\tU+10000–U+10FFFF A more common way that people talk about UTF-16 encoding, though, is in terms of code points called “surrogates”. All the code points in the range U+D800–U+DFFF—or in other words, the code points that match the binary prefixes 110110 and 110111 in the table above—are reserved specifically for UTF-16 encoding, and don’t represent any valid characters on their own. They’re only meant to occur in the 2-word encoding pattern above, which is called a “surrogate pair”. Surrogate code points are illegal in any other context! They’re not allowed in UTF-8 or UTF-32 at all.  Historically, UTF-16 is a descendant of the original, pre-1996 versions of Unicode, in which there were only 65,536 code points. The original intention was that there would be no different “encodings”; Unicode was supposed to be a straightforward 16-bit character set. Later, the codespace was expanded to make room for a long tail of less-common (but still important) Han characters, which the Unicode designers didn’t originally plan for. Surrogates were then introduced, as—to put it bluntly—a kludge, allowing 16-bit encodings to access the new code points.  Today, Javascript uses UTF-16 as its standard string representation: if you ask for the length of a string, or iterate over it, etc., the result will be in UTF-16 words, with any code points outside the BMP expressed as surrogate pairs. UTF-16 is also used by the Microsoft Win32 APIs; though Win32 supports either 8-bit or 16-bit strings, the 8-bit version unaccountably still doesn’t support UTF-8—only legacy code-page encodings, like ANSI. This leaves UTF-16 as the only way to get proper Unicode support in Windows. (Update: in Win10 version 1903, they finally added UTF-8 support to the 8-bit APIs! 😊)  By the way, UTF-16’s words can be stored either little-endian or big-endian. Unicode has no opinion on that issue, though it does encourage the convention of putting U+FEFF zero width no-break space at the top of a UTF-16 file as a byte-order mark, to disambiguate the endianness. (If the file doesn’t match the system’s endianness, the BOM will be decoded as U+FFFE, which isn’t a valid code point.)  Combining Marks In the story so far, we’ve been focusing on code points. But in Unicode, a “character” can be more complicated than just an individual code point!  Unicode includes a system for dynamically composing characters, by combining multiple code points together. This is used in various ways to gain flexibility without causing a huge combinatorial explosion in the number of code points.  In European languages, for example, this shows up in the application of diacritics to letters. Unicode supports a wide range of diacritics, including acute and grave accents, umlauts, cedillas, and many more. All these diacritics can be applied to any letter of any alphabet—and in fact, multiple diacritics can be used on a single letter.  If Unicode tried to assign a distinct code point to every possible combination of letter and diacritics, things would rapidly get out of hand. Instead, the dynamic composition system enables you to construct the character you want, by starting with a base code point (the letter) and appending additional code points, called “combining marks”, to specify the diacritics. When a text renderer sees a sequence like this in a string, it automatically stacks the diacritics over or under the base letter to create a composed character.  For example, the accented character “Á” can be expressed as a string of two code points: U+0041 “A” latin capital letter a plus U+0301 “◌́” combining acute accent. This string automatically gets rendered as a single character: “Á”.  Now, Unicode does also include many “precomposed” code points, each representing a letter with some combination of diacritics already applied, such as U+00C1 “Á” latin capital letter a with acute or U+1EC7 “ệ” latin small letter e with circumflex and dot below. I suspect these are mostly inherited from older encodings that were assimilated into Unicode, and kept around for compatibility. In practice, there are precomposed code points for most of the common letter-with-diacritic combinations in European-script languages, so they don’t use dynamic composition that much in typical text.  Still, the system of combining marks does allow for an arbitrary number of diacritics to be stacked on any base character. The reductio-ad-absurdum of this is Zalgo text, which works by ͖͟ͅr͞aṋ̫̠̖͈̗d͖̻̹óm̪͙͕̗̝ļ͇̰͓̳̫ý͓̥̟͍ ̕s̫t̫̱͕̗̰̼̘͜a̼̩͖͇̠͈̣͝c̙͍k̖̱̹͍͘i̢n̨̺̝͇͇̟͙ģ̫̮͎̻̟ͅ ̕n̼̺͈͞u̮͙m̺̭̟̗͞e̞͓̰̤͓̫r̵o̖ṷs҉̪͍̭̬̝̤ ̮͉̝̞̗̟͠d̴̟̜̱͕͚i͇̫̼̯̭̜͡ḁ͙̻̼c̲̲̹r̨̠̹̣̰̦i̱t̤̻̤͍͙̘̕i̵̜̭̤̱͎c̵s ͘o̱̲͈̙͖͇̲͢n͘ ̜͈e̬̲̠̩ac͕̺̠͉h̷̪ ̺̣͖̱ḻ̫̬̝̹ḙ̙̺͙̭͓̲t̞̞͇̲͉͍t̷͔̪͉̲̻̠͙e̦̻͈͉͇r͇̭̭̬͖,̖́ ̜͙͓̣̭s̘̘͈o̱̰̤̲ͅ ̛̬̜̙t̼̦͕̱̹͕̥h̳̲͈͝ͅa̦t̻̲ ̻̟̭̦̖t̛̰̩h̠͕̳̝̫͕e͈̤̘͖̞͘y҉̝͙ ̷͉͔̰̠o̞̰v͈͈̳̘͜er̶f̰͈͔ḻ͕̘̫̺̲o̲̭͙͠ͅw̱̳̺ ͜t̸h͇̭͕̳͍e̖̯̟̠ ͍̞̜͔̩̪͜ļ͎̪̲͚i̝̲̹̙̩̹n̨̦̩̖ḙ̼̲̼͢ͅ ̬͝s̼͚̘̞͝p͙̘̻a̙c҉͉̜̤͈̯̖i̥͡n̦̠̱͟g̸̗̻̦̭̮̟ͅ ̳̪̠͖̳̯̕a̫͜n͝d͡ ̣̦̙ͅc̪̗r̴͙̮̦̹̳e͇͚̞͔̹̫͟a̙̺̙ț͔͎̘̹ͅe̥̩͍ a͖̪̜̮͙̹n̢͉̝ ͇͉͓̦̼́a̳͖̪̤̱p̖͔͔̟͇͎͠p̱͍̺ę̲͎͈̰̲̤̫a̯͜r̨̮̫̣̘a̩̯͖n̹̦̰͎̣̞̞c̨̦̱͔͎͍͖e̬͓͘ ̤̰̩͙̤̬͙o̵̼̻̬̻͇̮̪f̴ ̡̙̭͓͖̪̤“̸͙̠̼c̳̗͜o͏̼͙͔̮r̞̫̺̞̥̬ru̺̻̯͉̭̻̯p̰̥͓̣̫̙̤͢t̳͍̳̖ͅi̶͈̝͙̼̙̹o̡͔n̙̺̹̖̩͝ͅ”̨̗͖͚̩.̯͓  A few other places where dynamic character composition shows up in Unicode:  Vowel-pointing notation in Arabic and Hebrew. In these languages, words are normally spelled with some of their vowels left out. They then have diacritic notation to indicate the vowels (used in dictionaries, language-teaching materials, children’s books, and such). These diacritics are expressed with combining marks.  A Hebrew example, with niqqud:\\tאֶת דַלְתִּי הֵזִיז הֵנִיעַ, קֶטֶב לִשְׁכַּתִּי יָשׁוֹד Normal writing (no niqqud):\\tאת דלתי הזיז הניע, קטב לשכתי ישוד Devanagari, the script used to write Hindi, Sanskrit, and many other South Asian languages, expresses certain vowels as combining marks attached to consonant letters. For example, “ह” + “\\u200bि” = “हि” (“h” + “i” = “hi”). Korean characters stand for syllables, but they are composed of letters called jamo that stand for the vowels and consonants in the syllable. While there are code points for precomposed Korean syllables, it’s also possible to dynamically compose them by concatenating their jamo. For example, “ᄒ” + “ᅡ” + “ᆫ” = “한” (“h” + “a” + “n” = “han”). Canonical Equivalence In Unicode, precomposed characters exist alongside the dynamic composition system. A consequence of this is that there are multiple ways to express “the same” string—different sequences of code points that result in the same user-perceived characters. For example, as we saw earlier, we can express the character “Á” either as the single code point U+00C1, or as the string of two code points U+0041 U+0301.  Another source of ambiguity is the ordering of multiple diacritics in a single character. Diacritic order matters visually when two diacritics apply to the same side of the base character, e.g. both above: “ǡ” (dot, then macron) is different from “ā̇” (macron, then dot). However, when diacritics apply to different sides of the character, e.g. one above and one below, then the order doesn’t affect rendering. Moreover, a character with multiple diacritics might have one of the diacritics precomposed and others expressed as combining marks.  For example, the Vietnamese letter “ệ” can be expressed in five different ways:  Fully precomposed: U+1EC7 “ệ” Partially precomposed: U+1EB9 “ẹ” + U+0302 “◌̂” Partially precomposed: U+00EA “ê” + U+0323 “◌̣” Fully decomposed: U+0065 “e” + U+0323 “◌̣” + U+0302 “◌̂” Fully decomposed: U+0065 “e” + U+0302 “◌̂” + U+0323 “◌̣” Unicode refers to set of strings like this as “canonically equivalent”. Canonically equivalent strings are supposed to be treated as identical for purposes of searching, sorting, rendering, text selection, and so on. This has implications for how you implement operations on text. For example, if an app has a “find in file” operation and the user searches for “ệ”, it should, by default, find occurrences of any of the five versions of “ệ” above!  Normalization Forms To address the problem of “how to handle canonically equivalent strings”, Unicode defines several normalization forms: ways of converting strings into a canonical form so that they can be compared code-point-by-code-point (or byte-by-byte).  The “NFD” normalization form fully decomposes every character down to its component base and combining marks, taking apart any precomposed code points in the string. It also sorts the combining marks in each character according to their rendered position, so e.g. diacritics that go below the character come before the ones that go above the character. (It doesn’t reorder diacritics in the same rendered position, since their order matters visually, as previously mentioned.)  The “NFC” form, conversely, puts things back together into precomposed code points as much as possible. If an unusual combination of diacritics is called for, there may not be any precomposed code point for it, in which case NFC still precomposes what it can and leaves any remaining combining marks in place (again ordered by rendered position, as in NFD).  There are also forms called NFKD and NFKC. The “K” here refers to compatibility decompositions, which cover characters that are “similar” in some sense but not visually identical. However, I’m not going to cover that here.  Grapheme Clusters As we’ve seen, Unicode contains various cases where a thing that a user thinks of as a single “character” might actually be made up of multiple code points under the hood. Unicode formalizes this using the notion of a grapheme cluster: a string of one or more code points that constitute a single “user-perceived character”.  UAX #29 defines the rules for what, precisely, qualifies as a grapheme cluster. It’s approximately “a base code point followed by any number of combining marks”, but the actual definition is a bit more complicated; it accounts for things like Korean jamo, and emoji ZWJ sequences.  The main thing grapheme clusters are used for is text editing: they’re often the most sensible unit for cursor placement and text selection boundaries. Using grapheme clusters for these purposes ensures that you can’t accidentally chop off some diacritics when you copy-and-paste text, that left/right arrow keys always move the cursor by one visible character, and so on.  Another place where grapheme clusters are useful is in enforcing a string length limit—say, on a database field. While the true, underlying limit might be something like the byte length of the string in UTF-8, you wouldn’t want to enforce that by just truncating bytes. At a minimum, you’d want to “round down” to the nearest code point boundary; but even better, round down to the nearest grapheme cluster boundary. Otherwise, you might be corrupting the last character by cutting off a diacritic, or interrupting a jamo sequence or ZWJ sequence.  And More… There’s much more that could be said about Unicode from a programmer’s perspective! I haven’t gotten into such fun topics as case mapping, collation, compatibility decompositions and confusables, Unicode-aware regexes, or bidirectional text. Nor have I said anything yet about implementation issues—how to efficiently store and look-up data about the sparsely-assigned code points, or how to optimize UTF-8 decoding, string comparison, or NFC normalization. Perhaps I’ll return to some of those things in future posts.  Unicode is a fascinating and complex system. It has a many-to-one mapping between bytes and code points, and on top of that a many-to-one (or, under some circumstances, many-to-many) mapping between code points and “characters”. It has oddball special cases in every corner. But no one ever claimed that representing all written languages was going to be easy, and it’s clear that we’re never going back to the bad old days of a patchwork of incompatible encodings.
